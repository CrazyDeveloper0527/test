How about discussing the project while sending files?
I'm interested in your payment patter.
And I want to know about the first delivery date and final date.
Also I'd like to receive the upfront payment (just 100$) to trust your pay ability.


I have a serious problem. 
From December 31st to January 3rd of the following year, I will not be able to proceed with the work due to personal problem.
Can we start working on it after that?
At that time, I'll send the contract prepared.


I'm prepared for send the result right now.
I think you're busy. so I worked all the night with my friend and we just finished an assignment.
But I have a seriouse problem.
That's something I can't be sure you'll pay exactly.
I have had the experience of not getting paid for the results several times before, so I have to be careful this time too.
So I thought about it for a long time and prepared a reasonable plan in my own way.
First, I will send you 30% of the completed assignments. We will also send the image files showing the entire task performance.
They are photoes of every chapter. you can convince your company.
If you are satisfied with the result, please pay 30% of the assignment upfront.
Once payment is confirmed, I will send the entire rest.
Then you send me the rest as well.
I think this option makes sense for everyone.
What do you think? Please consider carefully.
